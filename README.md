## Introduction

Provided is a skeleton code to with main() function and forward kinematics of a planar 3 DOF robot arm. 
A visual depiction is available in the attached .pdf
Your mission is to implement the Inverse Kinematics function

## Instructions
1. Init an empty GIT repository and commit the provided files
2. Create a CMake project for the task
3. Implement the inverse kinematics function and describe your approach
4. Create approrpiate test(s) to show the correct behavior of the Inverse Kinematics solver
5. Optionally, add visualization to the solving mechanism
